# AgriConnect
MandiHub (AgriConnect) is a web-based and mobile platform that connects small-scale farmers directly with local consumers and vendors, reducing intermediaries and food miles while improving farmer income and produce freshness. It provides farmers with tools to list and manage their inventory, receive and confirm orders, and track payments, while consumers can search for nearby produce, place orders, pay securely, and track deliveries in real time. Built using an Agile–Scrum approach, the system includes role-based dashboards (farmer, consumer, vendor, admin), integrated payments, analytics, and multi-language support, aiming to create a transparent, efficient, and sustainable digital agricultural marketplace.
